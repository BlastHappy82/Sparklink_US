# Sparklink_US Fork Documentation

## Goals:

Sparklink is hit or miss when it comes to feature improvement or updates. I forked this repo from the Chinese Repo and converted to english to hopefully a featurefull webdriver that will be highly compatible with any sparklink based webdriver keyboard.

Goals:
Translate to english: Complete
Create solution for global key capture for macro recording: In Work
allow advanced keys on function layers: Future TBD
per layer RGB control(FN0 different than FN1): Future TBD
Webdriver www. address that can use published SDK: Future TBD
Per key analog axis for controller emulation: Future TBD
