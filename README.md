# Sparklink_US Fork Documentation

## Intro
Sparklink is the driver behind many brands of keyboards and it suffers from very few feature updates and even worse is that a lot of brands are not linked to the main hub for sparklink so they may not get any updates at all. So I forked from the public sparklink repo to get an open source project and implement some improvements and fixes. Contributors Welcome
